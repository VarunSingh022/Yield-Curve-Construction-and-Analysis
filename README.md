# Yield-Curve-Construction-and-Analysis

THIS PROJECT AS A LEARNING PROJECT IN QUANTITATIVE FINANCE.

===Project Overview===

This project focuses on the construction and analysis of yield curves using multiple methodologies, including:

Nelson-Siegel Model

Nelson-Siegel-Svensson Model

Cubic Spline Interpolation

Additionally, it integrates macroeconomic analysis, bond risk management, and trading strategies to evaluate the impact of financial policies on fixed-income securities.

Features Implemented

1. Yield Curve Construction

Used different models (Nelson-Siegel, Nelson-Siegel-Svensson, and Cubic Spline) to construct the yield curve.

Visualized the fitted yield curves along with observed bond yield data.

2. Macroeconomic Analysis

Examined the impact of inflation rates and monetary policy rates on bond yields.

Computed correlations between macroeconomic indicators and the yield curve.

3. Zero-Coupon and Forward Rate Calculations

Implemented zero-coupon yield calculations using bootstrapping.

Computed forward rates to analyze the term structure of interest rates.

4. Duration and Risk Management

Macaulay Duration Calculation to measure bond sensitivity to interest rate changes.

Applied duration analysis to evaluate risk exposure in fixed-income portfolios.

5. Backtesting Fixed-Income Strategies

Implemented a bond trading strategy using Backtrader.

Defined simple buy/sell conditions based on yield movements.

Backtested the strategy on synthetic yield data and visualized performance.

***Results & Visualization***

The yield curve models are plotted for comparative analysis.

Correlation between macroeconomic variables and bond yields is displayed.

Backtesting results for the bond trading strategy are visualized using Backtrader.

***Applications***

Fixed Income Analytics: Understanding interest rate movements and term structure.

Monetary Policy Research: Studying the impact of economic policies on bonds.

Trading & Risk Management: Developing bond investment strategies and hedging interest rate risks.
